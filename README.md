- 👋 Hi, I’m Sangram Prusty
- 👀 I’m interested in applying concepts from statistical mechanics and non-linear dynamics to decipher complex biological phenomenon such as molecular recognition, allostery, cellular transitions etc.
- 🌱 I am experienced in molecular dynamics simulation, non-affine fluctuation formalism, elastic network models and markov state models.I’m currently learning non-linear dynamics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on understanding the role of fluctuations in modulating conformational transition as well as phase transition in biomolecular systems
